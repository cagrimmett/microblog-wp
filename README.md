# microblog

This will be a minimalist microblogging WordPress theme. After learning about the [micro.blog](http://micro.blog) project, I decided that I wanted to host my own microblog and use the micro.blog service to cross-post to Twitter, Facebook, and micro.blog. Since I already have my own website, I want this theme to be very minimal.

I used the [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) starter theme as the base I'm working from. 

## Roadmap

- [ ] Gravatar header pull-in from admin's email address
- [ ] Integrate a grid framework to make the theme mobile responsive
- [ ] Turn title on and off for posts
- [ ] Tagline output below header image
- [ ] Social icon outputs
